**About & Game Goals** 

Kasumi’s Last Walk is a 2D audiovisual storytelling experience which follows Kasumi, an old man at the end of his life, through his **last walk around the village he was born in**. Kasumi shares the wisdom of a fulfilled life through his narration with the goal of inspiring the player to think about the most fundamental questions that color everybody’s life at some point.  Kasumi progressively shares more emotion and leaves the player with a clear imperative at the end of the game – **to think!** 



**The Story** 

Kasumi is an old man who is only a few steps behind the end of his life. He chooses to spend his last minutes walking down a worn-out trail he always used to walk down through his life with the purpose of telling a story, **a summation of his life**. His story, although concise at times, is filled with continuous thinking which is a sign that, even at the end of his life, Kasumi doesn’t have the answers to all the fundamental questions but is aware of how to reach them. Kasumi concludes that the only way to answer these questions is to think deeply about the most basic of things around him, rivers, flowers, and rocks, which are the key to understanding love, in his opinion, the cornerstone of existence.  Regarding all other questions besides love, Kasumi cites Leonard Cohen’s “Anthem” which he finds to **be the perfect analogy to life.**

*“Ring the bells that still can ring,*

*forget your perfect offering,       there is a crack, a crack in everything* 

*that's how the light gets in”* 

***Leonard Cohen***

**Gameplay, Controls & Mechanics** 

The player starts the game by pressing the space key in the main menu and is instantly transferred to a scene in which Kasumi is already walking. The music and the narration start instantly and Kasumi, shortly after the start of the game, collects two sunflowers which light up the parallaxing scenery behind him. The player can notice at this point that there are differently colored collectible sunflowers. These sunflowers color the scenery in their corresponding color. **By collecting different sunflowers, the player can color the scenery in any way he chooses to.** Collecting too many sunflowers will color the scenery in an unpleasant way, while collecting too few sunflowers makes the scenery color very basic. Collecting some sunflowers can’t even be avoided. This is done to convey an analogy to life itself. Since the sunflowers are floating mid-air, the player must jump by pressing the space key to collect them. The player also can’t pause the game but can exit it at any time by pressing the “X” key. This feature is added to force the player to invest time into the experience and hear/see the story in its entirety and in one go. 


**The gameplay experience** is very minimal. There is no way to die, there are no obstacles or hardships, **only a scenery, colors, and a meaningful story**. The player can sit back and relax while consuming the game as an audiovisual experience or choose to color the scenery and add more meaning to the game. 


**Menu’s, Cutscenes & Intro’s**

When entering the game, the player can see the intro screen which features a sunflower icon. This icon is the first link between the player and the actual in-game experience.  

The Intro screen quickly switches to the main menu screen. **The main menu screen** features a quote about color by Oscar Wilde and makes the player anticipate coloring elements in the gameplay. The player is also informed about the basic controls in the game while at the main menu screen.


At the end of the game, the player is presented with a screen that features a quote by Leonard Cohen. **This is a quote which Kasumi wants the player to remember**, and which best sums up the experience into words. The player is also given the option to return to the main menu at this screen. 


**Intended Audience** 

Although the game is playable by all ages and groups since it contains no foul language, blood, or gore, it’s intended audience is 17+. **The game contains deep symbolism and understanding of the English language.** This qualifies the game for a ***PEGI – OK*** rating. 

**PEGI-OK** content **must not** contain the following:

- **Violence** 
- **Sexual activity or sexual innuendo**
- **Nudity** 
- **Bad language**
- **Gambling** 
- **Promotion or use of drugs**
- **Promotion of alcohol or tobacco**
- **Scary scenes**

**Tools  & Technical details**

The game is developed on the Unity2D platform using the C# programming language and Unity-specific libraries. The sprites and the artwork are a modified version of existing artwork libraries available on the Unity Asset Store.
